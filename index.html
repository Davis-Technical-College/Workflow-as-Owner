          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            The FIFA World Cup, often called the World Cup, is an international
            association football competition among the senior men's national
            teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football
            Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The
            tournament has been held every four years since the inaugural
            tournament in 1930, with the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the
            Second World War. The World Cup is the most prestigious association
            football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed
            and followed single sporting event in the world. The viewership of
            the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, close to half
            of the global population, while the engagement with the 2022 World
            Cup was estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people
            watching the final match.<br />
            <br />
            Seventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar,
            who hosted the 2022 event. The 2026 tournament will be jointly
            hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give
            Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in
            three World Cups.

          <h3>Qualification</h3>
          <p>
            The berths for the inaugural 1930 tournament were filled by
            invitation only. The 1934 one was the first one to have an actual
            qualifying phase. The first ever World Cup qualifying match was
            played on 11 June 1933, when Sweden defeated Estonia 6–2 in
            Stockholm, and the first goal was scored 7 minutes into the game,
            with some sources[1] attributing it to Swedish captain Knut Kroon
            while others[which?] credit it as an own goal by the Estonian
            goalkeeper Evald Tipner.<br /><br />
            The number of teams entering qualification stages has increased
            steadily, and in response the final tournament has also been
            expanded (having 16 teams until 1978, then 24 between 1982 and 1994,
            then 32 between 1998 and 2022, and finally 48 from 2026 onwards).
            While the format of the qualifying tournaments has evolved, teams
            have always been grouped into zones which have remained relatively
            unchanged and roughly correspond to the continents. The teams from
            each zone compete for a fixed number of berths for the zone, with a
            limited number of places being awarded to winners of
            intercontinental play-offs.
          </p>
          The FIFA World Cup qualification is a set of competitive matches that
          a national association football team plays in order to qualify for one
          of the available berths at the final tournament of the men's FIFA
          World Cup. Qualifying tournaments are held within the six FIFA
          continental zones, each organized by their respective confederations:
          AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North and Central America and the
          Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania), and UEFA
          (Europe). For each World Cup, FIFA decides the number of places in the
          finals allocated to each of the zones, based on the numbers and
          relative strengths of the confederations' teams. As a courtesy, the
          host receives an automatic berth selection, as has happened with the
          immediate past tournament winner during much of the competition's
          history. All other finalists are determined on a standalone qualifying
          round achievement without regard to previous achievements

          <h3>2026 FIFA World Cup</h3>
          <p>
            The 2026 FIFA World Cup, marketed as FIFA World Cup 26, will be the
            23rd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international men's soccer
            championship contested by the national teams of the member
            associations of FIFA. The tournament will take place from June 11 to
            July 19, 2026. It will be jointly hosted by 16 cities in three North
            American countries: Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The
            tournament will be the first hosted by three nations and the first
            North American World Cup since 1994. Argentina is the defending
            champion. <br /><br />
            This tournament will be the first to include 48 teams, expanded from
            32. The United 2026 bid beat a rival bid by Morocco during a final
            vote at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. It will be the first World
            Cup since 2002 to be hosted by more than one nation. With its past
            hosting of the 1970 and 1986 tournaments, Mexico will become the
            first country to host or co-host the men's World Cup three times.
            The United States last hosted the men's World Cup in 1994, whereas
            it will be Canada's first time hosting or co-hosting the men's
            tournament. The event will also return to its traditional northern
            summer schedule after the 2022 edition in Qatar was held in November
            and December.

          <h3>Fun facts of the FIFA World Cup</h3>
          <p>
            1. The World Cup is held every four years, the first of which took
            place in 1930. <br />
            2. The name of the original World Cup trophy is the Jules Rimet
            Trophy, named after the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who passed a
            vote to start the competition in 1929. <br />
            3. Uruguay was the host of the first-ever World Cup in 1930, and
            they also went on to win the tournament. <br />
            4. Russia hosted it’s first World Cup in 2018. <br />
            5. England has only ever hosted the tournament once, in 1966, which
            was also the only time they <br />
            ever won the tournament, defeating Germany in a dramatic last-minute
            4 – 2 win. They think it’s all over; it is now. <br />
            6. Almost half of the world’s population, that’s 3.2 billion people,
            tuned in to the 2014 World Cup. <br />
            7. The 2002 World Cup, hosted by both South Korea & Japan, was the
            first ever World Cup to be hosted by two different nations. <br />
            8. Brazil is currently the nation to boast the most World Cup wins,
            having won five. <br />
            However, Germany and Italy are both close behind them, having won
            four tournaments each. <br />
            9. Egyptian Goalkeeper, Essam El Hadary, is the oldest player to
            ever play in the World Cup at the <br />
            age of 45, having played at the 2018 Russian World Cup. After saving
            Saudi Arabia’s Fahad Al Muwallad’s penalty in his last game, he then
            became the oldest-ever goalkeeper to save a penalty at the World
            Cup. <br />
            10. The oldest person to ever score a goal at a World Cup was
            Cameroonian player Roger Milla, who scored against Russia in 1994.
